## Part 1 - Analysis

> In this part, you should present how you analyze the problem and list basic steps to show how the
> problem is solved.
> You can list libraries, techniques and algorithms you use in this program and even some mathematical
> equations.

> Example: Sum the square from 1 to $N$, $N$ will be given from `stdin`.

The problem is to calculate $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^2$, traditionally, we can use a loop to calculate item by item, but we can do that in an efficient way.  

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^ni^2=\dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$


## Part 2 - Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    
}
```

## Part 3 - Result & Verification

> In this part, you should present the result of your program by listing the output of test cases and optionally add a screen-shot of the result.  

Test case #1:

```
input: 
output: 
```

Test case #2:

```
```

**[Screen Shoot]**

## Part 4 - Difficulties & Solutions

Use `long long` to store the result.
