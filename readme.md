## Part 1 - Analysis

The problem is to calculate a set of expressions, including quadratic operations, variables, math functions.

## Part 2 - Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    
}
```

## Part 3 - Result & Verification

> In this part, you should present the result of your program by listing the output of test cases and optionally add a screen-shot of the result.  

Test case #1:

```
input: 
output: 
```

Test case #2:

```
```

**[Screen Shoot]**

## Part 4 - Difficulties & Solutions

Use `expression tree` to store and calculate the expression. Use `big_number` to store very big numbers(integer and float). Use `map` to store variables.
